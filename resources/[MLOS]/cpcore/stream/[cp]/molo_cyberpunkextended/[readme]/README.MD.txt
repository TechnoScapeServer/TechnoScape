Common Errors

Error parsing script / Failed to load script

Your server artifacts are likely outdated. Update your server to version 4752 or above.

You lack the required entitlement to do use <resource>

Try restarting your server and make sure your server license key is correct. If you bought the resource on the wrong account, you can transfer it to another account on keymaster.

Failed to verify protected resource

Files were possibly corrupted during transfer. Ensure hidden files are copied; the .fxap file in a protected resource must be included. Some FTP programs skip these files.


if you have some crash with NVE dont panic just delete NVE_Animated_Lights.rpf & NVE_ATM_Animation.rpf ( picture in this folder )
If you have some ghost into the map it's simply you use a other map i recommand to use my MRPD for compatibility :
